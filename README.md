# PatientSystem
The Java Patient System is a console-based application built to efficiently manage patient records, leveraging text file input/output for persistent data storage. This system offers a comprehensive set of functionalities, allowing users to add patients with their first name, last name, and date of birth, remove patients, and update their health status between "sick" and "recovered." Real-time statistics, including the number of sick, recovered, and total patients, are available, alongside the computation and display of the average age of all patients. Users can sort patients by age, first name, or last name, and introduce randomness by shuffling the patient order. The program promotes data integrity through file persistence, ensuring that patient data remains intact across program executions.
